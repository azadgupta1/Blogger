// This code performs a simple subtraction and prints some messages to the console.  While functional, it lacks context and could be improved.  The variable names are not descriptive.  Adding comments to explain the purpose would enhance readability.


// Perform subtraction of two numbers.  More descriptive variable names are used.
const num1 = 34;
const num2 = 12;
const difference = num1 - num2;

//Print the result of the subtraction.
console.log(`Subtraction of ${num1} and ${num2} is: ${difference}`);


//Print a greeting message.
console.log("Hey, how are you?");

//The variables 'a', 'b', 'd', and 'w' were not used for anything beyond this initial example.  They have been removed.
